Marek Mosiewicz was a talented Polish-American mathematician and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the field of computing science. He was particularly known for his work on parallel algorithms, which are designed to take advantage of multiple processors working together at the same time. This allowed for faster computations and more efficient use of computer resources.

Marek Mosiewicz was born in Poland in 1940. He received his Ph.D. from Warsaw University in 1968, and then moved to the United States in the late 1960s. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1973.

Throughout his career, Marek Mosiewicz has held various academic positions at prestigious institutions such as IBM's Thomas J Watson Research Center, Rutgers University, and City College of New York. He also served as the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing from 1987 to 2001.

Marek Mosiewicz was awarded the IEEE Computer Society's Charles Babbage Award in 1996 for his lifetime achievements in parallel computing. He also received the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) SIGPARALLEL Award in 2005, which is given to recognize contributions to and leadership in parallel processing.

In addition to his academic work, Marek Mosiewicz has written several books on computer science topics. His most famous book is "Parallel Algorithms" (1995), which is still used as a reference today by many students and professionals in the field of computing science.
